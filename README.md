# APLer's QuickStart Guide to the Raspbery Pi

## What to get, where to get it, how to get started

I'm developing this guide for Dyalog Limited as a resource for current or veteran APLers who want to experiment
with Dyalog's free APL for the Raspberry Pi.

The APL is freely available on the Pi for non-commercial use.
Commercial licensing is also available: contact sales@dyalog.com

## Getting started with the Pi

Many APLers are familiar with Microsoft Windows running on Intel platforms and with Mac OS.
Some are familiar with running Linux on desktop machines.

The Raspberry Pi is different, and the differences can be a bit daunting.

This guide aims to de-mystify the process of getting started with the Raspberry Pi
as an APL development platform.
