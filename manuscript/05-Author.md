### About the author

I'm Romilly Cocking and I have been using APL to solve problems since 1974.

I founded the British APL Association (then called the UK APL user group) in 1976.

For two decades I helped to run Cocking and Drury, a software house that specialised in APL.

I'm currently engaged in Robotics and AI research using APL as the implementation language.
