#The APLer's Guide to the Raspberry Pi


##Introduction

The Raspberry Pi is cheap to buy, fun to explore, and a very practical platform for APL. If you know APL, this document
will help you to get going with the Pi as quickly as possible. 

### Who should read this guide

If you're a current or veteran APLer and you want to experiment
with Dyalog's APL for the Raspberry Pi, this guide was written for you.

### Dyalog APL for the Raspberry Pi

The Dyalog Pi port is a fully featured 32-bit implementation. It's 100% compatible with other versions of Dyalog APL.

You can share workspaces and  component files with any other Dyalog APL system, and you can transmit APL arrays over
TCP sockets to or from the Pi.

Dyalog's APL is freely available on the Pi for non-commercial use.
Commercial licensing is also available: contact sales@dyalog.com

### Getting started with the Pi

Many APLers are familiar with Microsoft Windows running on Intel platforms and with MacOS.
Some are familiar with running Linux on desktop machines.

The Raspberry Pi is a little different, and differences can initially seem daunting.

This guide aims to de-mystify the process of getting started with the Raspberry Pi
as an APL development platform.

### What's covered

The guide covers what to buy, where to get it, how to set it up and how to install Dyalog APL.

### What's not covered

The guide assumes that you are familiar with APL. It does not cover how to use Dyalog's RIDE (Remote IDE), as
Dyalog already provide documentation on-line.

It does not cover Linux, though there is a link to some relevant learning resources at the end of the document.

Nor does it cover Physical Computing with the Pi (controlling lights and motors, reading buttons and potentiometers etc).
I'm planning a separate guide for that.
