##The 5 minute summary



This section contains the bare minimum of advice you need to get started quickly, but offers no explanation or discussion of alternative approaches. 

If you're happy with that just do what I suggest :) 

Most APLers don't just blindly follow the herd - that's why they are APLers! If you want to know the assumptions behind my advice and the alternatives available, read the whole document. 

If you just want to get going, here's the 5-minute version: 

  1. Buy a Raspberry Pi Starter Kit and make sure you have the other hardware you'll need 
  2. Connect the contents and boot it up 
  3. Install Dyalog APL 




###Buy a Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit



Raspberry Pi 3 starter kits are widely available in the UK, Europe and the USA. 

Look for one which has the following components: 

  * Raspberry Pi model 3 
  * 5v 2.5A Power supply which you can plug into your mains supply 
  * 8Gb SD card with NOOBS or Raspbian Pixel pre-loaded 



You'll also need a USB mouse, a USB keyboard (the Dyalog APL keyboard works best but any Keyboard will do), a monitor or TV with HDMI support and an HDMI cable to connect it to the Pi. 

You may also want to get a case. Some starter kits will include one. 

You'll need WiFi or a wired connection in order to install and update the Pi's software. 

The Raspberry Pi has built-in WiFi which you can configure once the Pi has booted up. You can also use a wired ethernet connection in which case you will also need an ethernet cable. 

Some starter kits include a keyboard and mouse; some don't. Check carefully and decide which one to get. 

The supplier I normally buy from is a UK company called Pimoroni. If you're based outside the UK Pimoroni ship overseas but a local supplier may be faster and cheaper. 

Pimoroni sell a starter kit for £85 (including mouse and keyboard) and an essentials kit (without mouse or keyboard) for £55\.
