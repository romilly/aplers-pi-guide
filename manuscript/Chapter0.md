#The APLer's Quickstart Guide to the Raspberry Pi



##Introduction

The Raspberry Pi is cheap to buy, fun to explore, and a very practical platform for APL. If you know APL, this document
will help you to get going with the Pi as quickly as possible. 

### Who should read this guide

This guide has been sponsored by Dyalog Limited as a resource for current or veteran APLers who want to experiment
with Dyalog's free APL for the Raspberry Pi.

The APL is freely available on the Pi for non-commercial use.
Commercial licensing is also available: contact sales@dyalog.com

### Getting started with the Pi

Many APLers are familiar with Microsoft Windows running on Intel platforms and with Mac OS.
Some are familiar with running Linux on desktop machines.

The Raspberry Pi is different, and the differences can be a bit daunting.

This guide aims to de-mystify the process of getting started with the Raspberry Pi
as an APL development platform.

### What's covered

The guide covers what to buy, where to get it, how to set it up and how to install Dyalog APL.

### What's not covered

The guide assumes you are familiar with APL. It does not cover how to use Dyalog's wonderful RIDE (Remote IDE), as
Dyalog already provide documentation on-line. I may do an introductory RIDE video if there is enough interest.

It does not cover Linux, though there is a link to some relevant learning resources at the end of the document.

Nor does it cover Physical Computing with the Pi (controlling lights and motors, reading buttons and potentiometers etc).
I'm planning a separate guide for that.
